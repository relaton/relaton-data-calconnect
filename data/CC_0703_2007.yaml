abstract:
- content: This document was created by the CalDAV Technical Committee of the Calendaring
    and Scheduling Consortium. It presents a list of features in the form of requirements
    for the scheduling extensions to CalDAV [RFC 4791], that is, the extensions to
    the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) [RFC 2518] protocol to specify
    a standard way of exchanging and processing scheduling messages based on the iCalendar
    Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) [RFC 2446].
