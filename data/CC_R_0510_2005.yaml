abstract:
- content: This document is one in a series of documents summarizing the results of
    questionnaires that the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium has conducted to
    help better understand the requirements, problems and needs for calendaring and
    scheduling solutions. It is expected that the results of these questionnaires
    will be used to help define requirements and recommendations for calendaring and
    scheduling products. This particular document summarizes the results of the Timezone
    Technical Committee's questionnaire on Timezone support in iCalendar products.
    Other questionnaire summary documents will cover different areas of calendaring
    and scheduling, and will be made available by the Consortium.
