abstract:
- content: This document was created by the TIMEZONE Technical Committee of the Calendaring
    and Scheduling Consortium. It contains information about common time zone implementation
    issues and recommendations on how to resolve these issues. We first justify the
    need for time zones, then we identify time zone implementation problems, and then
    offer some guidelines and recommendations. Take note that the listed recommendations
    often describe what vendors are currently doing to solve the problems.
