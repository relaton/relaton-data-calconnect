abstract:
- content: The goal of this questionnaire was to determine how and to what extent
    Calendaring is being used on mobile devices, with a view to using those results
    to aid in the development of recommendations on how to address any problem areas.
    A number of responses were received to the online questionnaire, and a summary
    and brief conclusion of these results is presented, along with the raw results
    themselves. Respondents to the questionnaire answered based on the capabilities
    of their device. The results show an aggregate of these results.
