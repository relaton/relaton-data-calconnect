abstract:
- content: This document was created by the USECASE Technical Committee of the Calendaring
    and Scheduling Consortium. This document is a survey of the present state of resource
    interoperability for a representative sample of calendaring, groupware, and project
    management applications. \"Interoperability of resources\" within the domains
    surveyed is a level of functionality that allows the communication of resource
    information between applications that is humanly useful though not necessarily
    identical for both systems.
