abstract:
- content: This document was created by the USECASE Technical Committee of the Calendaring
    and Scheduling Consortium. The document presents a recommendation for enhancing
    inter-operability of resources within the calendaring and scheduling application
    domain. Minimum interoperability is the basic level of functionality our collective
    experience tells us is necessary to have a useful system. The thrust of this effort
    is to enable resource inter-operability such that, when a described event contains
    resources, the recipient of that event is able to make practical use of the described
    resources; ideally the recipient should be so enabled regardless of whether the
    recipient is within the same calendaring domain. The resulting recommendations
    rely in part upon adoption of standards revisions that are in draft as of this
    writing.
