abstract:
- content: The Recurrence Technical Committee of The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium
    has collected specific information on how Calendaring and Scheduling implementations
    have, or have not, implemented the Recurrence Rules of RFCs 2445 and 2446, iCalendar
    and iTIP. This document is part of the committee's work to compile actual usage
    information and interoperability issues. The Recurrence Committee recently collected
    information in the form of a Recurrence Questionnaire, which allowed vendors and
    other producers and consumers of iCalendar recurrences to list the features of
    iCalendar that they implemented. The questionnaire also contained space for comments
    about each line item in the RFCs and also overall issues with recurrences. The
    Recurrence Technical Committee has since analyzed the results of the questionnaire
    into this document.
