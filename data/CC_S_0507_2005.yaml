abstract:
- content: This document is one in a series of use case documents that the Calendaring
    and Scheduling Consortium is developing to help better define the needs of different
    calendaring and scheduling user groups. As such, this document provides a list
    of use cases for a calendar access protocol only. Other use case documents will
    cover different areas of calendaring and scheduling, and will be made available
    by the Consortium in the usual manner. While this list of use cases was developed
    to assist in the development of the CalDAV protocol, none of the use cases are
    specific to CalDAV, that is, this list of use cases should apply to any calendar
    access protocol. It is expected that this document will be used as a basis to
    further develop technical requirements for a calendar access protocol such as
    CalDAV.
