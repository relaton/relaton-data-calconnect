abstract:
- content: This document was created by the Use Case Technical Committee of the Calendaring
    and Scheduling Consortium. The document defines the use cases for minimum interoperability
    of calendaring and scheduling. Minimum interoperability is the basic level of
    functionality our collective experience tells us is necessary to have a useful
    system. We realize that in some cases it may be more than is currently offered
    by 'basic' calendaring and scheduling applications.
