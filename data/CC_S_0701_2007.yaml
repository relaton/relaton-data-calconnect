abstract:
- content: This document was created by the Use Case Technical Committee of the Calendaring
    and Scheduling Consortium and defines the use cases for minimum interoperablity
    for tasks support (VTODO) for calendaring and scheduling. Minimum interoperability
    is the basic level of functionality our collective experience tells us is necessary
    to have a useful system. We realize that in some cases it may be more than is
    currently offered by 'basic' calendaring and scheduling applications.
