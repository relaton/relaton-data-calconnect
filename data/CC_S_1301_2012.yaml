abstract:
- content: "This document, developed by the XML Technical Committee, specifies a SOAP
    web services Protocol for calendaring operations. This protocol has been contributed
    to OASIS WS-CALENDAR as a component of the WS-CALENDAR Specification under development
    by OASIS.\nCalConnect and OASIS have agreed that any future work by CalConnect
    TC XML or OASIS WS-Calendar (or other committees in CalConnect and OASIS) on their
    respective versions of CalWS will be harmonized to maintain consistency between
    the versions. CalConnect and OASIS reserve the right to jointly and formally agree
    to fork the specifications at some point in the future if need arises. "
